Hi Dr. Wilkerson!

I wanted to answer the question, "If I live in Texas, what SNAP 
retailers can I go to nearby?" I decided that the most effective response is
a well-designed website: kiron-ang.github.io/SNAPmapTX.

I began by plotting the features "X" and "Y" and noticed that, thanks
to large size of the dataset, the shape of Texas had formed. I removed
three outliers that were outside the confines of Texas: Dime Box 
Grocery in Dime Box, TX; DOLLAR GENERAL 0353 in Madison, TX; and Dollar
General 15022 in China, TX. I selected colors that would stimulate
hunger to encourage users to find information on the nearest SNAP
retailer and actually purchase food as soon as possible.

Thank you for your time and evaluation.

Sincerely,

Kiron Ang
