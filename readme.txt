"SNAP Map" is an interactive map visualization I made to help people find retailers that accept SNAP in the state of Texas. It is available at kiron-ang.github.io/snapmap and answers the question, "What SNAP retailers are closest to a given point in Texas?" by utilizing the D3 JavaScript library. I filtered the data to keep only retailers in the state of Texas, and removed three outliers whose "X" and "Y" measurements were incorrect. I then plotted "X" and "Y" on a linear scale to create a map of Texas; clicking on the map area highlights the 10 closest SNAP retailers and populates the sidebar with relevant information. A box also appears in areas with overplotting. I fine-tuned my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to ensure that my website was accessible and responsive across multiple devices. Furthermore, the slow response I initially achieved on iOS Safari prompted me to optimize certain operations, such as distance calculations and data processing. My code is available at github.com/kiron-ang/snapmap.
